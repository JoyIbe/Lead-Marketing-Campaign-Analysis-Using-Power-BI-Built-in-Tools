## Objective:

The primary objective is to understand the effectiveness of lead generation efforts. Lead marketing campaigns focus on capturing and nurturing those leads to convert them into paying customers, increase brand awareness, and drive traffic to websites or landing pages.
Meanwhile, the dataset contained 15 Columns and 270,154 rows of data.

## Problem Statement:

Our lead marketing campaigns produce a good number of leads, but we do not know much about how they are performing in terms of product sales. This analysis is best suited to compare the performance of our various lead sources and campaigns in terms of conversion rates, time to first purchase, total value of all purchases, and impact of touchpoints through the customer journey. 
In this case, the goal is to determine which campaigns are generating the most sales and which ones should be adjusted for better results to achieve a high return on investment.

## Tools and Methodology:

### Tools: 

Power Query: Used power query to clean and restructure data for modelling to optimize performance speed.

Dax: Employed Dax functionalities to create a new table and calculate specific measures for key metrics and custom visuals.

Power BI: To build the interactive dashboard.

### Method:

Data Cleaning: This process of data cleaning carried out in this project includes:
 
- Handling missing numeric values, 

- Merging first and last name columns together and trimming off unwanted spaces,

- Handling inconsistencies such as incorrect spellings,

- Grouping age column into intervals,

- Lastly, standardizing specific data fields.

Data Processing: With Power Bi's Dax functionalities, I created calculated measures to show valuable metrics, customized and design visuals to aid clarity in understanding trends.

Data Modeling: Modeling this data allows for multiple tables with lesser column information to speed up processing time, reduce redundancy and increase efficiency.

Data Visualization: Built a two page interactive dashboards to properly communicate findings that will foster opportunities to optimize seasonal campaigns, better target specific demographics, and improve lead generation.

### Key Insights:

- The campaign generated 270,144 leads, a significant 52.67% increase compared to the previous year. This indicates strong growth in lead generation

- Revenue for the campaign stands at $37,167,083, also showing a 52.9% increase from the prior year. 

- Winter generated the highest number of leads (69K), followed closely by Summer (68K). Revenue aligns with seasonal lead distribution, with Winter leading at $9.5M, followed by Summer ($9.3M), Fall ($9.2M), and Spring ($9.2M). This consistency suggests a direct relationship between lead volume and revenue generated.

- The campaign recorded 1.42 million total touchpoints, emphasizing strong engagement across channels.

- The highest number of leads was generated on Friday, with a noticeable decline as the week progresses.

- Gender distribution is fairly balanced across all seasons: In Winter, there are 17,467 female leads and 17,264 male leads.

- The 20–29 age group dominates lead generation with 117,854 leads (largest segment). This is followed by the 30–39 age group with 105,013 leads and the 0–19 age group with 47,277 leads. These insights suggest that campaigns targeting younger audiences are more effective and should be prioritized.

- The campaign sources are evenly split, with Ads contributing 49.91% (134.82K) and Organic sources contributing 50.09% (135.32K).

- Instagram and TikTok each contributed approximately 50% of the leads.
This suggests both platforms are equally crucial for campaign success and should continue to be focal points for marketing efforts.

- The Quarterly Touchpoint Trend indicates that Sign-Up Touchpoints slightly exceed Purchase Touchpoints in all quarters.

### Key Insights

- The campaign achieved 53,888 total conversions, representing a 52.98% increase from the previous year. 

- The ROI stands at an impressive 147.8%, reflecting a 138.17% increase compared to the prior year.

- The CPL is $55.53, indicating that lead acquisition is relatively economical given the high ROI.

- The highest conversions occur in December, followed by May, August, and November. This suggests that end-of-year campaigns and mid-year promotions drive more customer activity.

135.04K leads are in the Sign-Up stage, requiring further nurturing to advance to conversion.
Retention stage accounts for 81.12K leads, while Conversions represent 53.89K leads.

- 20–29 age group leads with nearly equal gender distribution (11,853 female, 11,786 male). This is followed by the 30–39 age group and the 0–19 age group, where females slightly outnumber males in all segments.

- Organic leads have consistently driven more purchase touchpoints than Ads across 2021, 2022, and 2023.

- CPL is slightly lower for Organic campaigns, making it more cost-effective.

## Recommendations:

- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing seasons (Winter and Summer) and days (Friday and early weekdays) to maximize lead generation and revenue.

- Tailor campaign content to appeal to the dominant 20–29 age group while exploring opportunities to better engage other age groups.

- Continue investing in Ads and Organic strategies while analyzing specific channel performance to identify areas for improvement.

- Improve the overall touchpoint journey, ensuring seamless user experiences.

- Double down on Instagram and TikTok marketing strategies, as they drive an equal share of leads. Also, explore creating catchy content specific to these platforms to boost engagement further.

- Focus marketing efforts on Winter and late-year months like December while optimizing campaigns for Spring and Fall to improve overall balance.

- Invest in nurturing campaigns (emails, personalized offers) to move leads from sign-up to retention and conversion stages. Enhance retention strategies to ensure existing customers remain engaged.
